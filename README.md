Nanoacoustic vibrations
=================



This program is designed to calculate the frequency of the acoustic vibrations of metallic nanoparticles (sizes between 0.6 -  50nm) embed in glass, water and air. The nanoparticles in this code are represented by spheres.  To get the frequencies, we use the cross section calculated with Mie's theory and then replace the static radius of the sphere with a time-dependent radius. This conduces to get the time-dependent optical transmission that coincide with the experimental parameter ![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20%5CDelta%20T%20/%20T)

 Please see the **Theory** section at the bottom for an explanation of how this code is supported.
